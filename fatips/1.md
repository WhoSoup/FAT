# Overview

This document describes the functionality, datastructures, validation rules of
the **FAT-1** token standard: A non-fungible data only token standard built on
Factom chains and entries. It's functionality is most alike the ERC-721 token
standard of Ethereum.


# Motivation

Extend upon the FAT-0 standard by offering non-fungible token functionality for
unique, indivisible, and traceable assets.

Applications include tokenized equity, commodities, financial instruments, and
digital goods.


# Specification


## Token ID  `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)


## Addresses `extends` [FATIP-0](0.md)


## Token Issuance Chain

Unlike FAT-0, the issuance chain can contain multiple entries. FAT-1 allows the
ongoing issuance of unique tokens over time up to a maximum supply.


### Issuance Chain ID Derivation  `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)


### Token Issuance Entry `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

FAT-1 token issuance entries include a additional `tokens` field, which is an
array of unique token objects, each signed by the issuing identity .

Every token in the issuance must be valid for the issuance entry to be valid.
Issuing a token does not place the token into the circulating supply. Once
issued the token can be sent via coinbase transaction by ID to it's initial
bearer.


#### Individual FAT-1 Tokens `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

Each token in the `tokens` field must contain a unique ID with respect to this
FAT-1 token. I.e having two `greple` tokens with the ID `0` is illegal.
However, having a `greple` token with ID `0` and a `testfat0token` with ID `0`
is legal. It's best to choose short IDs since doing so maximizes the amount of
tokens that can be issued in a single issuance. As with any Factom entry, it's
maximum size can be 10KB in content.

## Token Transaction Chain

Inherits directly from the [FATIP-0](0.md) standard.


### Transaction Chain ID `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)

Identifier: `<tokenid>:transactions`


### Token Transaction Entry `extends`* [FATIP-101](101.md)

Transaction entries of FAT-1 tokens contain a `tokenIds` field, which is an
array of the tokenIds being sent in the transaction. Since the
`[input|output].amount` field is not relevant in the same way as FAT-0, it is
used as a means to secure the `tokenIds` field via djb2a hashing. With an
overwhelming probability this results in a transaction that has an unfeasibly
large integer `amount` to transfer on Factom for replaying a Factoid
transaction. This is in addition to the `nonce` which is a random integer used
as the timestamp in the signed Factoid transaction.

**\* = required for coinbase transaction**


#### Contextual Tansaction Validation

FAT-1 Tansactions must be validated in context of their order within the
transaction history to applied to an address's balance, just as in FAT-0.
Alternate and additional validation criteria is required to support
non-fungible functionality:

- Must meet and pass all applicable validation criteria specified in the above
  field table
- `signature` may not be reused for any transaction
- **IF**: The transaction is a coinbase transaction (From
  `FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC`):
  - `idSignature` may not be reused for any  coinbase transaction, issuance
    entry (`issuance.idSignature`), or token issuance signature
(`issuance.tokens[n].idSignature`)
  - Issuing `tokenIds`'s amount of tokens must not push the circulating supply
    of the token over it's maximum (`issuance.supply`). If the supply is
unlimited, this is ignored.
- **ELSE IF**: The transaction is a normal transaction:
  - All tokens in `tokenIds` must reside in the balance of `input.address`.

Assuming these criteria are met,  the tokens specified in `input.tokenIds` are
deducted from `input.address` and credited to `output.address`. In the case of
a coinbase transaction, the deduction does not occur for `input.address`.

This filtering and balance application process is repeated for all transactions
in chronological order to reach the current state of the token.


# Implementation `extends` [FATIP-0](0.md)

## Notes

Since issuances are ongoing, this standard requires syncing and listening to
chains instead of one.
